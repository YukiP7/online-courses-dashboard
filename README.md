## 📌 Problem Statement

An EdTech startup aims to expand its recorded lecture offerings but lacks data-driven insights into market demand. They've collected data from multiple EdTech platforms (including course metadata, views, instructors, and more) and need help understanding:

- Which course categories are most popular?
- What skills are in high demand within each category?
- How do languages and subtitle availability impact viewer engagement?
- Calculate the average number of views for each category, sub-category, and language to provide insights into viewer engagement patterns and inform strategic content development.
- What is the distribution of various Languages  in which a particular course is  created?

As a data analyst, your task is to clean, transform, and visualize this data to uncover strategic insights.
